1. General Information
The data file (ntl6_v12.csv) is made up of data on fish collected in the North Temperate Lakes from 1981 to 2022. Although the data contains many columns (specific observations about the fish), for the sake of this project we are ony concerned with a few factors, specifically length and weight.

2. Data and File Overview
This README file gives an overview fo the files within the hw4 folder (a subset in the broader github folder). The hw4 file contains the quarto markdown document which is the main document containing the code and short answers to the problem set. Additionally, there is a rendered document of the PDF version of the markdown, along with a csv file containing fish data collected in the North Temperate Lakes from 1981 to 2022, which is used to test the hypothesis.
